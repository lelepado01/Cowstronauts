# 🐮 Cowstronauts 🐄✨

This GitHub repository contains a udderly amazing game where you can spawn cows in space. It's a lighthearted project that aims to bring a smile to your face with its cow-themed humor. 

It's also a playground for me to experiment with Rust, bevy and game development. 

## 🐄🌈 Features:

    - [x] Spawn cows in space and watch them bounce around in zero gravity.
    - [x] Quadtree acceleration for efficient physics calculation.
    - [ ] Compute shaders for GPU-accelerated physics.
    - [ ] Polish with sounds maybe.
    
All to achieve maximum cow density!

## 🥛🐄 How to Play:

    Git clone the repository.
    cargo run
    Click to spawn cows.

If I don't finish this project, the reason is I'm probably lacking the mootivation.
